# üî• Generative AI Models

Generative Models like GANs and VAEs are the core of GenAI. These models can create new data, images, and even music, making them extremely powerful tools for creative applicaions.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Key Topics:

- [Autoencoders](): Basic and variational autoencoders.
- [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](): Standard GANs, conditional GANs, CycleGAN, StyleGAN.
- [Diffusion Models](): Understanding and applications in generative tasks.
- [Transformers in Generative AI](): Text, image, and code generation.
